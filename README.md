# PythonAugmented

A collection of `.sublime-syntax` files based off the official Sublime Syntax files for Python and reStructuredText.
Python Augmented is highly opinionated:

* Includes support for a variety of specialized directives.
* Tends to track the latest Python 3.
* Docstrings are reStructuredText.

I created Python Augmented because none of the syntax definitions I'd tried before were sufficient to drive my custom syntax highlighting (currently unreleased).
Python Augmented also falls short, but I intend to improve it according to a variety of goals that aren't currently published.
